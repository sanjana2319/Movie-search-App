### Overview Of the Project
â¦¿ Search a movie | series in the search text box visible. If the search-text(movie/series) exist it will display Movie poster with it's name and type, if it does not exsit you can see "No results Found".
â¦¿ Click on the Poster to read the description of the movie/series. 

### Some loop holes
â¦¿ As said it was asked to display 5 cards in a row but unfortunately the api fetchs for only one result and hence the implementation of this is not seen. I could have tried with differnt api but since it was instructed to me to use the given API I did not use the other.

â¦¿ Since the above implementation could not happen there was no need of Pagination. But I used it show I know it's implementation and have not forgotten or failed to implement.

### I tried my best to follow all the given instructions and gave atmost efforts to figure out for solutions and implementations.
