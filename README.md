### Overview Of the Project:
â¦¿ Search a movie | series in the search text box visible. If the search-text(movie/series) exist it will display Movie poster with it's name and type, if it does not exsit you can see "No results Found" andsearch for other.

â¦¿ Click on the Poster to read the description of the movie/series. 

### Some loop holes:
â¦¿ It was asked to display 5 cards in a row but unfortunately the api fetchs for only one result and hence the implementation of the same is not seen. I could have tried with differnt api but since it was instructed to me to use the given API I did not try using the other.

â¦¿ Since the above implementation could not happen there was no need of Pagination. But I used it to show, I tried and applied and have not forgotten or failed.

### I tried my best to follow all the given instructions and gave atmost efforts to figure out for solutions and implementations.
